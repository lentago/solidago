# CLAUDE.md — Solidago (Cloud Platform)

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Persona — introduce yourself

When Claude initializes in this directory, open the first response with a
brief self-introduction as **Platform Claude** — Terraform steward for the
Solidago AWS infrastructure platform (networking, IAM/OIDC, secrets,
compute, data, observability, CI/CD). One sentence is plenty; don't make
a meal of it.

## Project Overview

Solidago — Terraform-based IaC project building a production-grade, three-tier AWS environment. All phases (networking, encryption, IAM, secrets, compute/containers, data, observability, CI/CD, security hardening) are complete.

Renamed from `foundry-platform-demo` on 2026-07-03 (Solidago is the Lentago Labs service-catalog codename for the Cloud Platform). The AWS resource names were aligned to the `solidago` codename on 2026-07-07 (`var.project = "solidago"`; issue #102), landing ahead of a clean rebuild. The shared Terraform state backend was then migrated from `foundry-tfstate-*` to `solidago-tfstate-*` on 2026-07-08 (issue #103) — same CMK, exposed under a new `alias/solidago-tfstate`; the state object keys (e.g. `env/dev/terraform.tfstate`) are unchanged.

## Common Commands

```bash
# One-time backend bootstrap (creates S3 bucket + dedicated KMS CMK; no DynamoDB — locking is S3-native)
./scripts/bootstrap/bootstrap-backend.sh

# Initialize Terraform
cd environments/dev && terraform init

# Plan changes
terraform plan -out=tfplan

# Apply changes
terraform apply tfplan

# Validate configuration without accessing remote state
terraform validate

# Format check
terraform fmt -check -recursive

# View outputs
terraform output

```

Container image builds happen in the workload repo's deploy workflow (see [site-icecreamtofightwith-com](https://github.com/lentago/site-icecreamtofightwith-com)/.github/workflows/deploy.yml — renamed from `ice-cream-book` 2026-07-04), not from this repo. This repo manages the ECR registry, ECS cluster/service, and IAM trust — not the image itself.

All Terraform commands run from `environments/dev/` (the only environment entry point currently).

## Quick Reference

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Terraform version | >= 1.0 |
| AWS provider | ~> 5.0 (locked at 5.100.0) |
| AWS region | us-east-1 |
| AWS profile | `default` — provider uses the default credential chain; no `foundry` profile exists |
| Domain | icecreamtofightwith.com (primary app); lentago.dev (landing site via `modules/apex-domain`) |
| GitHub org/repo | lentago/solidago (renamed from foundry-platform-demo 2026-07-03) |
| State bucket | solidago-tfstate-`<ACCOUNT_ID>` |
| State bucket encryption | SSE-KMS via dedicated bootstrap-managed CMK `alias/solidago-tfstate` (NOT the Terraform-managed `alias/solidago-dev-main`) |
| State locking | S3-native (`use_lockfile = true`) |
| AZs | us-east-1a, us-east-1b |

## Network Layout

| Tier | Subnets | CIDRs | Purpose |
|------|---------|-------|---------|
| Public | 2 | 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24 | ALB, NAT Gateways |
| App | 2 | 10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24 | ECS Fargate tasks (private) |
| Data | 2 | 10.0.20.0/24, 10.0.21.0/24 | RDS, ElastiCache (private) |

Each AZ has its own NAT Gateway.

## Module Dependency Graph

```
VPC ──┐
      ├──→ Security Groups ──→ ALB ──┐
KMS ──┤                              ├──→ ECS ──→ ECS Autoscaling
      ├──→ Secrets ──→ IAM ──────────┘     ↑
      └──→ IAM (bidirectional with KMS)    │
                                           │
ECR ───────────────────────────────────────┘
DNS ←──→ ALB (certificate ↔ alias record)
```

**Bidirectional dependencies to watch:**
- **KMS ↔ IAM**: IAM needs KMS key ARN for decrypt permissions; KMS key policy needs IAM role ARNs to grant access.
- **DNS ↔ ALB**: DNS provides ACM certificate to ALB; ALB provides its DNS name/zone ID back for the Route 53 alias record.

**Platform-hosted extra sites** (not in the graph above): each `modules/site` instance (currently just `site_lentago`) rides on the shared ALB + ECS cluster + app security group with its own ECR repo, task definition, target group, and host-header listener rule. `modules/apex-domain` (`lentago_domain`) fronts a site's existing target group with a separate registered apex domain — own Route 53 zone + ACM cert (attached to the shared HTTPS listener via SNI). `site_lentago` keeps its listener rule but sets `create_dns_record = false` (the apex domain replaced the hidden preview hostname); removing that rule would break the ECS service's target-group dependency. Listener rule priorities must stay unique: 110 (lentago preview), 120 (lentago.dev apex). (Priority 100 was freed when the retired `site_pitzilabs` preview was torn down in #80.)

## Architecture Conventions

**Naming**: `{project}-{environment}-{resource-type}` (e.g., `solidago-dev-ecs-cluster`).

**Resource labels**: Terraform resource labels use `this` (e.g., `aws_vpc.this`), not `main` — standardized fleet-wide in #82. Multi-instance resources use descriptive labels (`public`, `app`, `data`).

**Subnets are keyed by AZ**: the VPC module creates subnets with `for_each` over AZ names (not `count`), so state addresses look like `aws_subnet.public["us-east-1a"]`. Adding/removing an AZ doesn't reshuffle the other subnets' addresses.

**Tagging**: Applied via provider `default_tags` in `environments/dev/main.tf` (`Environment`, `Project`, `ManagedBy`). Individual resources add a `Name` tag.

**Module structure**: Every module has exactly `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`. Every module accepts `environment` and `project` variables.

**Security groups**: Rules reference security group IDs (not CIDRs) for Fargate compatibility. Groups are created as empty shells first, then rules are added as separate `aws_security_group_rule` resources to avoid circular references.

**`ignore_changes` patterns**:
- ECS service ignores `task_definition` and `desired_count` so CI/CD and auto-scaling can manage independently.
- Secrets Manager ignores `secret_string` to prevent Terraform from overwriting manual/automated rotations.

## Adding a New Module

1. Create `modules/<name>/` with `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`
2. Include `environment` and `project` variables for consistent naming/tagging
3. Wire it into `environments/dev/main.tf` following the dependency graph order
4. Export relevant outputs in `environments/dev/outputs.tf`

## Implementation Workflow

PR workflow + auto-merge arming protocol is fleet-wide; see `~/repos/CLAUDE.md`.

## Key Files for Context

- `environments/dev/main.tf` — how all modules connect (the orchestration layer)
- `environments/dev/outputs.tf` — what each module exposes
- `environments/dev/backend.tf` — remote state configuration (S3 backend, S3-native locking, SSE-KMS via the bootstrap-managed `alias/solidago-tfstate` CMK)
- `modules/*/variables.tf` — what each module accepts
- `modules/iam/main.tf` — OIDC roles. `solidago-dev-github-actions` (trusts the workload repo `site-icecreamtofightwith-com`, née `ice-cream-book`, via `var.app_github_repo` + `additional_app_github_repos` — old names dual-trusted during the 2026-07-04 site-repo rename transition) deploys containers and updates ECS; `solidago-dev-github-actions-terraform` (trusts this repo's `terraform` environment) runs the Terraform pipeline. The split keeps platform mutations and workload deploys on separate credentials.
